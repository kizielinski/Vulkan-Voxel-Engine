# Vulkan-Voxel-Engine
Repository for me to work on my voxel engine I'm building in Vulkan (1.2.182.0) and to experiment with new rendering techniques.

Update December 9th 2021
Features Implemented
•	Vulkan Library
  o	Rendering Pipeline
•	Basic Voxel Generation
  o	Classes and Hierarchy (might put nodes within Voxels themselves)
Improvements to be Made
•	Rework how loading the model file works (or have it generate a simple cube)
•	Make access to individual voxels available
Run the Code
To run my code, please download and install the following:
  o	Vulkan SDK (1.2.182.0)
  o	GLM-0.9.9.8
  o	glfw-3.3.4.bin.WIN64
