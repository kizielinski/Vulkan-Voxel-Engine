# Vulkan-Voxel-Engine
Repository for me to work on my voxel engine I'm building in Vulkan (1.2.182.0) and to experiment with new rendering techniques.

Update December 9th 2021

Features Implemented
*	Vulkan Library
  *	Rendering Pipeline
*	Basic Voxel Generation
  *	Classes and Hierarchy (might put nodes within Voxels themselves)
Improvements to be Made
*	Rework how loading the model file works (or have it generate a simple cube)
*	Make access to individual voxels available
Run the Code
To run my code, please download and install the following:
  *	Vulkan SDK (1.2.182.0)
  *	GLM-0.9.9.8
  *	glfw-3.3.4.bin.WIN64
